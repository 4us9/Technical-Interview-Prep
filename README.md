# Technical-Interview-Prep
Inspired by Marmik.

This repository is a collection of coding problems that I have solved to prepare for technical (SWE) interviews. 

Questions are completed in Java.

Topics from [Neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/practice) and Leetcode: Arrays & Hashing, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Stack, Binary Search, Linked List, Trees, Tries, Heap/Priority Queue, Backtracking, Graphs, 1-D Dynamic Programming (DP), 2-D Dynamic Programming (DP), Greedy, Intervals, Math & Geometry, Bit Manipulation, Matrix, Sorting, and Prefix Sum.
